# SOUND
A very simple application for the automated design of ultrasound surgery instruments,
for the longitudinal vibrations only :( 

Facilities:
- calculation of resonans length for appropriate frequency
- optimization of wave conductor amplification
- visualization of wave conductor countour (only 2D)
- visualization of stress [MPa], and displacement [mm] of wave conductor

Discalimer:
- use application on your own fear & risk
- an interface is ugly and unfortunately I have no time to fix it  

A project had been created as my own course work for "Electroacoustic transducers".
It was 2009 when I was studying at Biomedical department of Bauman Moscow State Technical University
